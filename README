This project is something about my raspi robot

1. Remote control try to control raspi robot via wifi.

Used raspirobotboard lib to control motion of robot.
Below GPIOs in BCM mode used
LEFT_ENABLE_PIN = 4
LEFT_FORWARD_PIN = 17
LEFT_REVERSE_PIN = 27
RIGHT_ENABLE_PIN = 10
RIGHT_FORWARD_PIN = 11
RIGHT_REVERSE_PIN = 9

Used cradlecamera class to control cam of robot
The cradlecamera used I2C to control a driver board to generate PWM
to control servo of cam
